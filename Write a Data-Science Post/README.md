## Project Introduction & Business Understanding

Considering the possible large volume of features and price indicators, I think the Boston Airbnb is more interesting to discover.

The Airbnb housing is strongly influenced by customer preference and housing prices, so our goal is to explore the influential factors to the two. We focus on location and amenities.

Boston Airbnb data of listings are collected and investigated. We ensure the exploration is under CRISP-DM Process.

## Target Goal

1. What is the relationship between location and price?

2. What are the most popular amenities?  

3. What are the top amenities that influence the price? 

## File Description

1.Jupyter Notebook solving the three problems.

2.Detailed Listings data for Boston Airbnb.
