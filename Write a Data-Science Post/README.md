## Project Introduction & Business Understanding

Considering the possible significant differences comparing two datasets, I think the Boston and Seatle Airbnb Project is more interesting to discover.

The Airbnb housing is strongly influenced by customer preference and housing prices, so our goal is to explore the influential factors to the two. A contrast between different places will make discovery easier.

Boston and Seattle Airbnb data of listings are collected and investigated. We ensure the exploration is under CRISP-DM Process.

## Target Goal

1.Is there any noticeable difference between Seattle and Boston Airbnb?
2.What are the most important features influencing rental price?
3.What are the top amenities people needs most?

## File Description

1.Jupyter Notebook solving the three problems.
2.Detailed Listings data for Boston Airbnb.
3.Detailed Listings data for Seattle Airbnb.
