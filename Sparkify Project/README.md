#Spark ML: Sparkify User Churn Analysis and Prediction

This project aims to utilize the power of Spark to analyze user churn and classify potential loyal users of Sparkify, a simulated music streaming service.     
As modern applications involve more and more users, analyzing big data of user information brings great values for business solutions and decision-making. Churn aims to tell whether a user will continue to use your application, and user behaviors give us insights to predict user churns.      
This project is conducted on Amazon Web Services using EMR Notebook integrated with Elastic MapReduce and Pyspark sessions. Our dataset for analysis has a volume of 12GB, from Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree.
